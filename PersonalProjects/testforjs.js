 

var name // a declared variable, but not initialized and it is in the global scope...which is bad.//

let myName = 'Bobby' // a declared AND initialized ES6 Variable -- scope matters, must study more about this.//

const ANSWER = 42 // constant that does not change, constant primitive value. 
//strings are a set of characters, strongest avenger, always start at zero//
let string1 = 'Hello Bobby\'s World!'

let string2 = newstring('Hello World') // an example of an objects constructor method, 'new' is a keyword in JS//

let one = 1
let two = '2'
//one + 2 This will print ('12')//
//You cannot do equatinos on strings//
//concatination in javascript//
// 1+2 = 3//
